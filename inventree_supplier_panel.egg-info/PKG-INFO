# inventree-supplier-panel

This is a plugin for [InvenTree](https://inventree.org), which gets data from a
supplier like Mouser and puts it into the InvenTree Database. 

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/SergeoLacruz/inventree-supplier-panel
```

## What it does
The plugin uses the scheduled task mixin and runs every few minutes. On each run it
synchronizes one part with the distributor Mouser. In case no supplier part exists
the plugin creates one and ads the mouser part number to the SKU field. In case a 
supplier part with supplier Mouser already exists the plugin creates new price breaks. 
Mouser allows 1000 hits per Day. So the plugin can run every two minutes. 

Parts are excluded from the synchronisation if:

- the part is not active
- the part is not purchasable
- the category of the part is excluded. 

Because there is no "purchasable" flag on categories we use metadata to exclude it. 
Put {"supplier_sync": {"exclude": "True"}} into the metadata field of the category. 

## Configuration Options
### Supplier API key
Accessing the Mouser REST API requires an access key. You can create it easily on the Mouser 
WEB page. Put the key here.

### Supplier Link
Put here the link to the API. Usually it is constant and does not need to be changed but who knows. 

### Proxies
In case you need to authorise a proxy server between your InvenTree server and the internet
put the required sting here for example something like { 'https' : 'https://user:password@ipaddress:port' }
Please refer to the code for details.

### Locale
Here you can set the locale for your system. The setting is used to convert price that is
reported. E.g. Mouser reports prices with commas and an euro sign. 

### Create Supplierparts
When the switch is on, the plugin does a part number search at the supplier and creates 
a supplier part in case it finds a match (see description). If off, this part is skipped. 
Only price breaks on existing supplier parts are synchronized. 

### The actual component
This is the primary key of the next component to be synchronized. It is a persistent storage 
of the plugin and changes automatically. You should not touch it.

## How it works
The Mouser API limits the access frequency and the total number of accesses per 24 hours. 
Because of that the plugin runs every two minutes and works always on one part. It uses
a setting to persistently store the primary key of the next part to by synchronized. To 
get the value we use cache=False option of the get_settings function. Otherwise plugin 
does not work properly as the value is not correctly changed.

In case the part has no supplier part from the supplier Mouser the plugin tries to create one. 
It runs a part number search on the mouser API with the manufacturer part number. We use
the name field of the part for the MPN. This might be different in your setup. So take care. 
The search can return several results e.g. BC107 will find BC107A as well. 
In case Mouser reports exactly one hit, a supplier part is created and the mouser part number
is put into the SKU field. In case more than one parts are reported the plugin creates a supplier
part and ads a generic string into the SKU field. The plugin cannot decide which part is the 
right one. These parts can be sorted out manually.

In case the part has already a Mouser part an exact search on the SKU is executed. This search 
usually finds exactly one result. In that case all price breaks are replaced with actual ones. 
It might happen that the search does not return any result. In that case the part has been
removed from Mouser and the supplier part is deleted. 

## Things to to
Actually you need to scroll through the log to find problems with the received data. This
is not comfortable. 

Error handling is not good yet. In case Mouser return garbage the plugin might just crash 
because keys in the json might be missing

The plugin should be more generic to easier support other suppliers like Digikey. 

The process of adding supplier parts automatically might be questionable depending on the 
setup. It works in our setup as we add exactly one MPN to each part. In case of a different
setup this part of the plugin can easily be removed. The more important part is anyhow the
update of the price breaks.

E.g. Mouser sends more data like availability, packaging and so on. I may make sense to 
include these into the properties to update.
